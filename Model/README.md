- `My_e2e.py`: The main model.
- `Beran.py`: A faster version of `S_Pool.py` when `degree=10`.
- `S_pool.py`: Sobolev test statistics calculation.
- `model_fix_direction/`: This directory contains the modified model versions with fixed directions. This model has more parameters but is much faster, making them suitable for longer RRI sequences (length n). It has a complexity of O(n). We do not provide the training weights for this model. However, if you set `batch_size` to 20000+ and use a 2080Ti GPU, it takes about 1 minute to train an epoch on the complete UVAF dataset.
