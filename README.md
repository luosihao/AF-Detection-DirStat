# AF-Detection-DirStat
A novel End-to-End Atrial Fibrillation Detection Model inspired by directional statistics. The model leverages Sobolev test statistics to quantify irregularity in heart rhythms and R-R interval variability. It's designed for interpretability, computational efficiency, and excellent generalization capabilities.
